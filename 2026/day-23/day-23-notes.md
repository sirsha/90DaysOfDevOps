# Day 23 – Git Branching & Working with GitHub

## Task 1: Understanding Branches

1. What is a branch in Git?
* A branch is a separate workspace use to make changes without affecting main project. A branch points to a commit in git history. 

2. Why do we use branches instead of committing everything to `main`?
* If we commit everything to main then production will break. We only commit to main when the code is verified and works
perfectly. That is why we use branches, experiment on other branches first then commit.

3. What is `HEAD` in Git?
* HEAD points to the latest commit in the git history.

4. What happens to your files when you switch branches?
* Git doesn't store multiple copies of your files as per branche. When you switch branches, git rewrites your working directory to match the commit of the branch you switched to. If that branch has older version you will see older version.
   - Untracked files from previous branch remain untouched.
   - Tracked file will be as per the current branch's commit.
   - Staged files from previous branch need to be stashed, otherwise git may block switch to avoid overwriting.

## Task 2: Branching Commands — Hands-On

1. List all branches in your repo
2. Create a new branch called `feature-1`
3. Switch to `feature-1`
4. Create a new branch and switch to it in a single command — call it `feature-2`
5. Try using `git switch` to move between branches — how is it different from `git checkout`?
6. Make a commit on `feature-1` that does **not** exist on `main`
7. Switch back to `main` — verify that the commit from `feature-1` is not there
8. Delete a branch you no longer need
9. Add all branching commands to your `git-commands.md`

## Task 3: Push to GitHub

1. Create a **new repository** on GitHub (do NOT initialize it with a README)
2. Connect your local `devops-git-practice` repo to the GitHub remote
3. Push your `main` branch to GitHub
4. Push `feature-1` branch to GitHub
5. Verify both branches are visible on GitHub
6. Answer in your notes: What is the difference between `origin` and `upstream`?
  * `Origin` -  Points to your remote repository.
  * `Upstream` - Points to the repository you forked from.
    - If not forked then no need of upstream.

## Task 4: Pull from GitHub

1. Make a change to a file **directly on GitHub** (use the GitHub editor)
2. Pull that change to your local repo
3. Answer in your notes: What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?
 * `fetch` - Only downloads changes from the remote. It does not merge them into your local branch. 
    The fetched commit reference is saved in the FETCH_HEAD file.
 * `pull` - Downloads the changes and merges them into your local branch.

## Task 5: Clone vs Fork
1. **Clone** any public repository from GitHub to your local machine
2. **Fork** the same repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
3. Answer in your notes:
   - What is the difference between clone and fork?
     * `Clone` - Clone means copying repository to your local computer. It is connected with remote.
     * `Fork` -  Copying someone else’s repository into your own GitHub account.
   
   - When would you clone vs fork?
     * I will fork a repository from publicly available repos into my GitHub account and use it. 
     * I will clone if I want a local copy of a repository. I can work on it freely. 
   
   - After forking, how do you keep your fork in sync with the original repo?
     * There is a option avilable on GitHub, SyncFork. You can update a fork using that option.
