## Task 3: Issues
1. Create an issue on one of your repos from the terminal — give it a title, body, and a label
2. List all open issues on that repo
3. View a specific issue by its number
4. Close an issue from the terminal

5. Answer in your notes: How could you use `gh issue` in a script or automation?
    * By combining gh issue commands in a script, you can automate workflows such as:
      - gh issue list
      - gh issue comment <issue num>
      - gh issue close <issue num>

5. Answer in your notes:
   - What merge methods does `gh pr merge` support?
      * merge commit
      * rebase merge
      * squash merge

## Task 5: GitHub Actions & Workflows (Preview)
1. List the workflow runs on any public repo that uses GitHub Actions
2. View the status of a specific workflow run

3. Answer in your notes: How could `gh run` and `gh workflow` be useful in a CI/CD pipeline?
    * They allow you to automate workflows without interactive sessions, making it easy to trigger, monitor, 
     and manage GitHub Actions directly from scripts or automation tools.
